Also, you might hear some oriental motifs, mixed with artificial electronic stuff – well, ideas kept popping up and I didn’t resist. It can sound somewhat eclectic (very unusual for me, isn’t it?) but that’s how I see it for now.`,

        description: `The song was composed during one of the worst periods of my life. I was facing big problems I had no idea how to manage. I had lost my grandpa and I was discovering just how snaky and selfish people could be.
        One day I went to my university and saw a big sign depicting a flower growing out of the snow. The inscription said “All reborn”. That made me cry like a baby but turn in the right way. But it will be the next day and the day before I felt like a big piece of darkness. I went home and drank first beer, then cognac. After this medicine, all my black thoughts came out and this song was born.`,

        "Apologise & Promise" was out as a rough demo a couple of years before this release, however, this version sounds very different from the initial idea.
        Finally, "Angel's Dance: Page Not Found" was mainly composed at the music school I used to work in 2013. The idea came up when I was watching the snowflakes falling and dancing in the air.
        I still love this music, and I hope, you'll like it too.`,

You can hear an amazing voice of Julia Melnik throughout the song, and there is just a short solo of mine.`,
